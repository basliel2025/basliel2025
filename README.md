👋🏻Hello! My name is<strong> Basliel Sisay</strong> (he/him). <br><br>👨‍💻I am a dedicated Software Engineering student currently studying at<strong> CTBE</strong> (formerly AAiT) 🎓.

My passion lies in Web Development 🌐- where creativity meets technology to build impactful digital solutions. At the moment, I am focused on mastering the fundamentals of<strong> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </strong>⚡. 

I am actively following the<strong> Odin Project</strong> roadmap 🛣️ to become a well rounded Full-Stack Developer. Through this journey, I am not only learning the technical aspects but also practicing problem solving, critical thinking, and real world project development 🔧.

Currently, I am working on hands on projects 🛠️ that challenge me to apply my knowledge, improve my design sense, and gain practical experience in delivering responsive and user friendly web applications.

My goal is to grow into a professional <strong>Full-Stack Engineer 💼</strong> who can design, develop, and deploy modern web applications that make a difference. I am always eager to collaborate, learn from others, and contribute to meaningful projects.

🚀 Driven, curious, and determined that’s how I would describe myself in this journey of becoming a future ready developer.
